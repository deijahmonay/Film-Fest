* The app uses session-based authentication. User must sign-up/ sign-in to access their movie entries.
* The app‚Äôs files are organized following the conventions taught in lectures.
* The app has at least one data entity in addition to the User model: **User** & **Movie**. User's can have as many movies in their index as they'd like.
* The app has full CRUD functionality. Users can create new movie entries, view an index page that lists all of their movies, show page to view specific details about specific movies in there database, the ability to edit movie details (make edits for title, release date).
* Authorization is implemented in the app. Guest users (those not signed in) should not be able to create, update, or delete data in the application or access functionality allowing those actions.
* The app is deployed online so that the rest of the world can use it via GitHub.

### Stretch Goals
* Ability to rate movies after they've been watched (with stars)
* Lists all cast members, and links a description of people on the cast
*Link to trailer for movie 
* Ability for user to Movie poster for each entry they make
* Where to watch-- a way for users to list different platforms that stream the movies. Possibly a tag
* Ability for users to write a short review of movies after they have been watched.
* Ability to have certain movies show within the platform for all users. A search that can show other users reviews of movies.
